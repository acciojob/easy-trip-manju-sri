# easy-trip-manju-sri
You are planning for a vacation with your friends. You come across the ease-my-trip website for your flight bookings. You are fascinated by the how beautifully the backend systems work and try to replicate the ease-trip

You have to build a SpringBoot Application easy-trip. You can use hashmaps as your Data Structure for the same.

Try to follow the Spring architecture where you build the controller layer, service layer and the repository layer which contains the HashMaps.

All the API’s details that need to be completed are given in the template itself. Make sure you don’t change the existing code/method names/end points of the application. Don’t use the lombok library.

Incase the @Autowired does not work and it throws errors for all the functions
